Download Build 2.zip, should run the same as the previous build.
Controls are the same as the previous build.
Go through the test level, jumping over the wall and touching the blue object to progress to the first randomly generated level. 
There are two randomly generated levels, with pillars and enemy targets to navigate around. The enemy targets will be destroyed
if you shoot them, and touching them will damage you, decreasing your health. Running out of health will restart the game.
