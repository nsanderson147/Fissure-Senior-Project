# Fissure-Senior-Project

Github's file upload limit meant I couldn't upload the full uncompressed project file, so I just uploaded a zip file.

The project should already be compiled, just run the .exe. If that doesn't work you'll have to open the project file in Unity.

Controls:
WASD keys- Move       
Mouse move- Look        
Space- Jump       
Left click- Fire  
Escape - Quit Game
