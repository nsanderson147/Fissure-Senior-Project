# Fissure-Senior-Project

Github's file upload limit meant I couldn't upload the full uncompressed project file, so I just uploaded a zip file.

Download the most recent zip (FissureBuild2) and extract.

The project should already be compiled, just run the .exe. If that doesn't work you'll have to open the project file in Unity.

Controls:
WASD keys- Move       
Mouse move- Look        
Space- Jump       
Left click- Fire  
Escape - Quit Game

Go through the test level, jumping over the wall and touching the blue object to progress to the first randomly generated level. 
There are two randomly generated levels, with pillars and enemy targets to navigate around. The enemy targets will be destroyed
if you shoot them, and touching them will damage you, decreasing your health. Running out of health will restart the game.
