# Fissure-Senior-Project

Github's file upload limit meant I couldn't upload the full uncompressed project file, so I just uploaded a zip file.

Download the most recent zip (FissureFinalBuild) and extract.

The project should already be compiled, just run the .exe. If that doesn't work you'll have to open the project file in Unity.

Controls:
WASD keys- Move       
Mouse move- Look        
Space- Jump       
Left click- Fire  
Escape - Quit Game

Press any key at the title screen to start the game. In each of the 3 randomly generated rooms, the goal is to find the blue pillar at the end and touch it. Once you reach the last pillar, press escape to quit the game.
