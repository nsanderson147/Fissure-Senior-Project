# Fissure-Senior-Project

Github's file upload limit meant I couldn't upload the full uncompressed project file, so I just uploaded a zip file.

The project should already be compiled, just run the .exe. If that doesn't work you'll have to open the project file in Unity.

Controls:
WASD keys- Move
Mouse move- Look
Space- Jump
Left click- Fire

Bullet collision is currently broken, so this demo just consists of running through the course as the turrets fire at you. You can shoot bullets to see them bounce, but they won't affect the turrets.
